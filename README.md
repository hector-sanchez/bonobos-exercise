# BONOBOS - Exercise


### Import Files

I had to massage the import files a bit before running the import. To successfully run the data import, you'll need to use the CSV files adjacent herein. Click [here](https://github.com/hector-sanchez/bonobos-exercise/blob/master/store-api/README.md) to view the steps necessary to run the data import.


### BONOBOS - API

To run the API navigate to the store-api folder after having forked the project and run the following from the terminal:

```rails s```

**This runs the app locally using port 3000. It is important to make sure port 3000 is used since the API has that address:port hardcoded.**



### BONOBOS - Web

To run the web application navigate to the store-web folder after having forked the project and run the following from the terminal:

```npm start```

This runs the web application on port 3100.
